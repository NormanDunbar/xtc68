Cross compiler for QDOS c68 on POSIX platforms

This is a resurrection of the 1999-ish code base to compile on modern POSIX systems (well Linux at least). No effort has gone into updating the obsolete DOS and NT variants.

The compilation forces -m32 to avoid having to fix numerous 32bit long assumptions.
