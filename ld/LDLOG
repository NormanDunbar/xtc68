                        DEVELOPMENT HISTORY
                        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Dec 89              QDOS port done by Jeremy Allison
                    This is based on a PD program GSTLINK for the
                    Atari ST that was SROFF compatible, but output
                    Atari ST format object files.   The changes
                    allow QDOS format files to be output

20/07/91  1.12  DJW Program version message not output if listing to
                    file unless verbose flag set
20/07/92  1.13  DJW Changed -bufp and -bufl to assume any value less
                    than 1000 is a size in K (used to be less than 250)
02/12/92  1.14  DJW Caused more error messages to give the FILE and
                    position on which a problem occurred
10/01/93  1.15  DJW Suppressed progress messages to screen unless the
                    -v flag is specified.
01/06/93  1.16  DJW Minor alterations to compile OK with new ANSI
                    version of c68
10/03/94  1.17  DJW Removed some '' keywords that were applied
                    to variables used with & operator.  This had been
                    missed by earlier releases of C68.
06/11/94  1.18  DJW Added new error message for table size exceeded,
                    and changed source accordingly.
16/02/96  1.19  DJW If a library file is not found on any of the library
                    search paths, check current directory as well.
24/03/96  1.20  DJW Incorporated Jonathan Hudson's XTC68 changes.

VERSION 2:      This is a major reworking of the LD linker with the
                following objectives in mind:

        a)  To make the linker case sensitive by default.  The
            older case-insensitive mode will still be available
            via a command line flag.

        b)  To remove the need for the -BUFP parameter by switching
            to a method of linked areas that are dynamically allocated
            as needed.   Also provides a speed-up due to removal of
            the need to shuffle memory around as much.

        c)  To provide support for Runtime Dynamic Link Libraries.

        d)  To improve the level of listings available.

        e)  To improve error reporting.

FUTURE IDEAS

        a)  To allow for both unix style CLI interface, and also
            the older GST interface (this is already partially
            implemented)

        b)  To support RANLIB style libraries for faster linking
